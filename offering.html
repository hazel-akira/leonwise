   <p>At First Baptist Church of Kenya, we believe in the importance of giving back to God as an act of worship and stewardship. Your offerings support the various ministries and programs of our church, enabling us to spread the message of God's love and serve our community with compassion and excellence.
    <br>
    Why Give? <br>

    Giving is a fundamental aspect of our faith journey. Scripture teaches us the principles of generosity and stewardship, emphasizing the joy and blessing that come from giving back to God.
    <br>
    Malachi 3:10 (NIV) says: "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this," says the Lord Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it."
    <br>
    When you give faithfully and cheerfully, you partner with us in fulfilling the mission and vision of our church, impacting lives and transforming communities for the glory of God.
